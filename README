I. Adding the meta-doom layer to your build
===========================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-doom layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-doom layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-meta-doom \
    "


II. Misc
========

This layer provides the Chocolate-doom game engine, a fork of the original doom engine used for the 90's game. The meta-layer also provides Freedoom as free to use game assets. Combined t provides a free-to-play implementation of doom. You may also want to add your own WAD files through your own recipes.

*Note: Get a [shareware WAD](http://www.pc-freak.net/files/doom-wad-files/Doom1.WAD) if you don't own the game.*
